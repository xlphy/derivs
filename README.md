Follow the Mark Joshi's book on C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives Pricing, [book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Derivatives-Pricing-Mathematics-Finance/dp/0521721628). Hopefully, it also provides some useful modules and scripts that new interesting applications can be built on. 

Follow Luigi Ballabia's book on Implementing Quantlib, [book on Amazon] (https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-QuantLib-Quantitative-finance-architecture/dp/B08KHSZK86). Build a mini-version of it, to just get a taste of the design.
